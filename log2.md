# 100 Days Of Code: Round 2 - Log

## Day 1: January 29, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved challenges on Codewars with fellow FrauenLoopers JIll and Frannie who inspired me to do another round of 100 Days of Code.

**Thoughts:** It's hard to solve challenges "out loud" when people are watching. But that's something most people know. I also noticed that after the task is solved, I want to get off with it as soon as I can, which I do. Instead, it would be great to think/talk about refactoring, to look at other solutions, to compare.

## Day 2: January 30, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Tried to solve the FizzBuzz challenge with Python in a more optimized way. Learned that there are no switch statements in this language, as it appears to be redundant syntactic sugar. Went with if/else blocks. Also, when testing, had to solve the problem of my function not returning anhything by design. Made it return an array of outputs instead. Not sure if it's the optimal way to go about it.

Set up a Flask project to train. For now I'm coding along with a tutorial but I aim to tweak it and make my own :)

**Thoughts:** After React Flask looks like something from the last century. There's even a Bootstrap package which seems to provide some older version of the library!
