# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up the 100 Days of Code Repo, added the README file to the Raptors of Berlin project.

**Thoughts:** I started the challenge to mainly spend more time working on actual projects (which I tend to start and never finish). Although I'm still not sure if small things like creating README files count as coding, they surely do take time.
