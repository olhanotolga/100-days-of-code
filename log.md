# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Set up the 100 Days of Code Repo, added the README file to the Raptors of Berlin project.

**Thoughts:** I started the challenge to mainly spend more time working on actual projects (which I tend to start and never finish). Although I'm still not sure if small things like creating README files count as coding, they surely do take time.

## Day 2: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spent some time refactoring my freeCodeCamp Responsive Design projects, e.g. made the navigation menu expansible and collapsible under the certain screen width. (Added an event listener to multiple elements using a for loop.)

**Thoughts:** Need to practice more manipulating DOM with JavaScript. At the moment, it takes a long long time...

## Day 3: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued DOM manipulation with JS. Watched The Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy and tried out some things I was curious about. This time, I was either coding ahead of the lesson or doing something different than what's in the videos.

**Thoughts:** I need to learn to think more about the logic as well as overall structure. Exercising patience (and also learning) will help me come up with more complex solutions.

## Day 4: June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spend several hours polishing one of my projects — a knowledge base for subtitlers working for the Molodist Film Festival (Kyiv, Ukraine). The project itself is built with Flask, which renders Jinja-enclosed Bootstrap-powered HTML templates. I mostly worked with text and styles, converting everything into Ukrainian and finalizing the readme file for the GitHub repo page. I also re-deployed it to Python Anywhere, so that it's up to date.

**Thoughts:** It's increadible how I managed to forget so much of what I was actively doing a few months ago! On the other hand, I now have a better understanding of what I'm doing (wrong), why, and how to fix it :)

## Day 5: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I finally started learning Regex on freeCodeCamp because I want to later apply it in my project, which is a knowledge base for film festival translators. Alongside the fCC exercises, I put together a pen where I check user input with a simple regex (a set of words separated by the alternation operator) and output if she/he is a hipster or not. It was also more DOM practice.

**Thoughts:** My current use case of regex is primitive. Still, I had fun :)

## Day 6: June 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Did not have much time, so I continued learning regex on freeCodeCamp. Got stuck on the challenge (Restrict Possible Usernames), had to look up the possible solution.

**Thoughts:** I feel weird because my solution to the fCC challenge looks way more complicated than it seems it should be...

## Day 7: June 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Went through a few more regex exercises on freeCodeCamp. Refactored yesterday's username-checking challenge and put together another pen that checks if input contains multiple spaces in a row.

**Thoughts:** It gets more interesting with regex. Will definitely look for more resources on this later.

## Day 8: June 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Done the rest of the regex exercises on freeCodeCamp. Upgraded yesterday's tool to not just find multiple spaces in a row but remove redundant spaces (also before commas, periods etc.).

**Thoughts:** Regex is both fun and frustrating. "Back in the day" I thought making a redundant space remover would be super simple. It kind of is ...not.

## Day 9: June 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created the layout for a JS calculator (a current project with FrauenLoop), done the debugging exercises on freeCodeCamp, and coded along a JS-based color guessing game. Will be debugging the latter tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Had fun coding along a game but found it a bit frustrating that I didn't have (allow myself) the time to think ahead. Also frustrating that my H1 background color does not reset to the initial one!

## Day 10: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Did exercises on freeCodeCamp (data structures), learned a bit of bash scripting, and played around with the look and feel of the color game. Fixed the issue with the h1 — "steelblue" turned out to be an invalid color name for JS.

**Thoughts:** Learned something, did something fun. Not a bad day :)

## Day 11: June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finally created aliases for the paths to my most frequently worked in directories! After spending some time on bash exercises, I switched back to the color game. Managed to change the styling a bit more and added an expansible & collapsible rules block.

**Thoughts:** I have a feeling that I'll spend some time on customizing that color game.

## Day 12: June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spend a few hours doing Basic Data Structures exercises on freeCodeCamp. Not without a struggle.

**Thoughts:** I feel that it's enough for today.

## Day 13: June 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Watched the Udemy Web Dev course, the sections on jQuery. Played around with it a bit. Nothing serious.

**Thoughts:** I keep hearing that it's not worth learning jQuery. Still, I'd stumbled upon so much of it when looking up JS-related things that knowing it does more good than harm.

## Day 14: June 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Watched the MIT lecture on Data Wrangling, tried a few things on the command line. Did a few challenges on SoloLearn.

**Thoughts:** Thinking about a regex project I'm about to start (mostly about how to approach it), also about primitive data types in JS and how tricky they can be.

## Day 15: June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Practiced constructing quick regex patterns with [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/), then coded the JS calculator during today's FrauenLoop class. Aside from JS-related stuff, learned about the value and type attributes within the button element.

**Thoughts:** Although a calculator is considered to be beginner-friendly and super basic, it takes quite some time for a new to grasp it. Lots of 'oh wow!' moments.

## Day 16: June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** A friend of mine suggested that I contribute to his project, for which I need to know the basics of Vue.js. So, really, all I did is watched the Vue.js tutorial and played around with my first primitive app.

**Thoughts:** Lots of excitement about the upcoming project, as well as lots of frustration because of going back to watching tutorials.

## Day 17: June 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued the Vue.js tutorial from yesterday, tried to understand how components are interconnected with each other and with my HTML document (it turned out I should have left the latter alone).

**Thoughts:** I was frustrated because I couldn't seem to understand Vue's basic concepts (until I found out that you nest components within templates of parental components...). I swear I'll do something better yesterday!

## Day 18: June 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Vue.js tutorial from yesterday, still trying to understand the relationship between components and continuing to build my 'hello-world' app.

**Thoughts:** This will take quite some time...

**Link to work:** [Link to the intro Vue.js course, once again](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/components) (keeping my hello-world app locally atm)

## Day 19: June 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** More Vue.js today — this time with Scrimba & documentation. Playing around with my app, managed to transfer certain blocks of code (together with all their functionality, of course) into separate components. Outlined my next regex tool (for checking the order of timecodes in subtitles). Solved a simple coding problem on SoloLearn.

**Thoughts:** Vue.js is still very frustrating but getting interesting. I should start with less code and relations' diagrams next time.

## Day 20: June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Troubleshooting my hello-world Vue.js app. Couldn't figure out why reviews weren't displaying once I submitted them. Turned out the mounted function responsible for this was lost among the methods (while it should have been a method of its own within the Vue component).

**Thoughts:** I've got too much code for a start, ugly reviews form, and the app itself makes little sense... :)

## Day 21: June 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Did some styling (and also conditional class-binding) of my hello-world Vue.js app. The reviews section looks much much better and makes more sense, at least visually.

**Thoughts:** Decided to take a break today from trying to learn everything and also from scolding myself for not having accomplished greatness and ultimate wisdom.

## Day 22: June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the JS calculator. During the FrauenLoop session, refactored a few functions and practiced unit testing with jest. Then added functionality to operate multiple-digit numbers and display them on the calculator screen. Woohoo! Still missing some important calculator functionality but the main chunk is done.

**Thoughts:** Thought that I'm juggling too many projects at once.

## Day 23: June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** More work on my JS calculator, crossing the first 3 items off the following to-do list:

- enable the +/- (sign changing) button
- enable the , (floating point) button
- enable the % (percentage) button
- add and enable the ^ (square root) button
- rearrange the buttons in a more efficient way
- add an easter egg animation
- enable operations with the result (i.e. not reset upon pressing "=")

There were also drawbacks.

For example, there are several issues with floats:

1. you can't use the floating point in a number twice
2. zero character after the floating point should be concatenated (not evaluated)

And another issue with +/-: you can't currently use it twice in the very beginning, before the input is set. Reason: the program is trying to evaluate "--" as a Number. Will fix later.

**Thoughts:** I'm going nice and slow today.

## Day 24: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Solved problems from the Basic Algorithm Scripting section on freeCodeCamp. Learned and used a bunch of array and string methods I didn't know about.

**Thoughts:** Was really exciting to solve these problems. It's awesome there are tests that serve as hints to solutions. In reality, I need to start thinking about things like use cases on my own.

## Day 25: June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Tidying up my JS calculator.
Made sure that:

- one can't create numbers with more than 1 floating point
- one can't add a floating point after having turned input into percent. so, clicking '%' checks if input < 1. if yes, can't use ','
- 0.20 is a valid number and inputs like 0.30303 are possible (fixed by converting inputs to numbers at calculation, not before)
- once "+/-" is clicked before input is set, "-" is displayed. upon the 2nd click on "+/-", "-" is replaced with 0
- -0 and similar should be replaced with 0. for now, I'm updating the display once operator is set
- because of a confusion with truthy & falsy values, I managed to replace input1 with input2 if input1 was equal to 0. fixed by changing the condition from (!input1) to (input1 == undefined)

Also, implemented animation which activates once you divide by zero. Will work on its improvement (e.g. separation of concerns) later.

Remaining issues:

- remove zeroes from the beginning of the input string except a single zero that precedes "."
- remove zeroes from the end of the result number if result is a float (!Number.isInteger(result))
...

**Thoughts:** Wow, a day of breaking and making things!
