# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Set up the 100 Days of Code Repo, added the README file to the Raptors of Berlin project.

**Thoughts:** I started the challenge to mainly spend more time working on actual projects (which I tend to start and never finish). Although I'm still not sure if small things like creating README files count as coding, they surely do take time.

## Day 2: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spent some time refactoring my freeCodeCamp Responsive Design projects, e.g. made the navigation menu expansible and collapsible under the certain screen width. (Added an event listener to multiple elements using a for loop.)

**Thoughts:** Need to practice more manipulating DOM with JavaScript. At the moment, it takes a long long time...

## Day 3: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued DOM manipulation with JS. Watched The Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy and tried out some things I was curious about. This time, I was either coding ahead of the lesson or doing something different than what's in the videos.

**Thoughts:** I need to learn to think more about the logic as well as overall structure. Exercising patience (and also learning) will help me come up with more complex solutions.

## Day 4: June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spend several hours polishing one of my projects — a knowledge base for subtitlers working for the Molodist Film Festival (Kyiv, Ukraine). The project itself is built with Flask, which renders Jinja-enclosed Bootstrap-powered HTML templates. I mostly worked with text and styles, converting everything into Ukrainian and finalizing the readme file for the GitHub repo page. I also re-deployed it to Python Anywhere, so that it's up to date.

**Thoughts:** It's increadible how I managed to forget so much of what I was actively doing a few months ago! On the other hand, I now have a better understanding of what I'm doing (wrong), why, and how to fix it :)

## Day 5: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I finally started learning Regex on freeCodeCamp because I want to later apply it in my project, which is a knowledge base for film festival translators. Alongside the fCC exercises, I put together a pen where I check user input with a simple regex (a set of words separated by the alternation operator) and output if she/he is a hipster or not. It was also more DOM practice.

**Thoughts:** My current use case of regex is primitive. Still, I had fun :)
