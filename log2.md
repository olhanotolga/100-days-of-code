# 100 Days Of Code: Round 2 - Log

## Day 1: January 29, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved challenges on Codewars with fellow FrauenLoopers JIll and Frannie who inspired me to do another round of 100 Days of Code.

**Thoughts:** It's hard to solve challenges "out loud" when people are watching. But that's something most people know. I also noticed that after the task is solved, I want to get off with it as soon as I can, which I do. Instead, it would be great to think/talk about refactoring, to look at other solutions, to compare.
