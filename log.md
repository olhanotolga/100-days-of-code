# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Set up the 100 Days of Code Repo, added the README file to the Raptors of Berlin project.

**Thoughts:** I started the challenge to mainly spend more time working on actual projects (which I tend to start and never finish). Although I'm still not sure if small things like creating README files count as coding, they surely do take time.

## Day 2: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spent some time refactoring my freeCodeCamp Responsive Design projects, e.g. made the navigation menu expansible and collapsible under the certain screen width. (Added an event listener to multiple elements using a for loop.)

**Thoughts:** Need to practice more manipulating DOM with JavaScript. At the moment, it takes a long long time...

## Day 3: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued DOM manipulation with JS. Watched The Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy and tried out some things I was curious about. This time, I was either coding ahead of the lesson or doing something different than what's in the videos.

**Thoughts:** I need to learn to think more about the logic as well as overall structure. Exercising patience (and also learning) will help me come up with more complex solutions.

## Day 4: June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spend several hours polishing one of my projects — a knowledge base for subtitlers working for the Molodist Film Festival (Kyiv, Ukraine). The project itself is built with Flask, which renders Jinja-enclosed Bootstrap-powered HTML templates. I mostly worked with text and styles, converting everything into Ukrainian and finalizing the readme file for the GitHub repo page. I also re-deployed it to Python Anywhere, so that it's up to date.

**Thoughts:** It's increadible how I managed to forget so much of what I was actively doing a few months ago! On the other hand, I now have a better understanding of what I'm doing (wrong), why, and how to fix it :)

## Day 5: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I finally started learning Regex on freeCodeCamp because I want to later apply it in my project, which is a knowledge base for film festival translators. Alongside the fCC exercises, I put together a pen where I check user input with a simple regex (a set of words separated by the alternation operator) and output if she/he is a hipster or not. It was also more DOM practice.

**Thoughts:** My current use case of regex is primitive. Still, I had fun :)

## Day 6: June 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Did not have much time, so I continued learning regex on freeCodeCamp. Got stuck on the challenge (Restrict Possible Usernames), had to look up the possible solution.

**Thoughts:** I feel weird because my solution to the fCC challenge looks way more complicated than it seems it should be...

## Day 7: June 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Went through a few more regex exercises on freeCodeCamp. Refactored yesterday's username-checking challenge and put together another pen that checks if input contains multiple spaces in a row.

**Thoughts:** It gets more interesting with regex. Will definitely look for more resources on this later.

## Day 8: June 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Done the rest of the regex exercises on freeCodeCamp. Upgraded yesterday's tool to not just find multiple spaces in a row but remove redundant spaces (also before commas, periods etc.).

**Thoughts:** Regex is both fun and frustrating. "Back in the day" I thought making a redundant space remover would be super simple. It kind of is ...not.

## Day 9: June 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created the layout for a JS calculator (a current project with FrauenLoop), done the debugging exercises on freeCodeCamp, and coded along a JS-based color guessing game. Will be debugging the latter tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Had fun coding along a game but found it a bit frustrating that I didn't have (allow myself) the time to think ahead. Also frustrating that my H1 background color does not reset to the initial one!

## Day 10: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Did exercises on freeCodeCamp (data structures), learned a bit of bash scripting, and played around with the look and feel of the color game. Fixed the issue with the h1 — "steelblue" turned out to be an invalid color name for JS.

**Thoughts:** Learned something, did something fun. Not a bad day :)

## Day 11: June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finally created aliases for the paths to my most frequently worked in directories! After spending some time on bash exercises, I switched back to the color game. Managed to change the styling a bit more and added an expansible & collapsible rules block.

**Thoughts:** I have a feeling that I'll spend some time on customizing that color game.
