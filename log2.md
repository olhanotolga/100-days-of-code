# 100 Days Of Code: Round 2 - Log

## Day 1: January 29, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Solved challenges on Codewars with fellow FrauenLoopers JIll and Frannie who inspired me to do another round of 100 Days of Code.

**Thoughts:** It's hard to solve challenges "out loud" when people are watching. But that's something most people know. I also noticed that after the task is solved, I want to get off with it as soon as I can, which I do. Instead, it would be great to think/talk about refactoring, to look at other solutions, to compare.

## Day 2: January 30, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Tried to solve the FizzBuzz challenge with Python in a more optimized way. Learned that there are no switch statements in this language, as it appears to be redundant syntactic sugar. Went with if/else blocks. Also, when testing, had to solve the problem of my function not returning anhything by design. Made it return an array of outputs instead. Not sure if it's the optimal way to go about it.

Set up a Flask project to train. For now I'm coding along with a tutorial but I aim to tweak it and make my own :)

**Thoughts:** After React Flask looks like something from the last century. There's even a Bootstrap package which seems to provide some older version of the library!

## Day 3: January 31, 2021

**Today's Progress:** More Flask training, learned about forms and form validation.

Reviewed user stories and made mockups for my full-stack project at FrauenLoop.

**Thoughts:** Making mockups is excruciating!

## Day 4: February 1, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Learning about React router, implementing it in the CountryByCountry project I've been working on. Wrapping my head around all the pushes and redirects.

**Thoughts:** With React Router, I had to change quite a bit of logic to make it all work. Either I'm facing maintainability issues or I simply need to document the logic somewhere (or both).

## Day 5: February 2, 2021

**Today's Progress:** More React router training. Also started a new project, a small fake e-commerce website. Will be working on it for the rest of the week. Made mobile designs with Canva, implemented the basic React structure.

Started playing around with the cat themes on Canva for the Rent a Cat project. I'm still missing mockups.

**Thoughts:** Canva's applying styles (colors/fonts) to a design makes life much much easier and the projects prettier, although husband says all my creations look pretty much the same :)

## Day 6: February 3, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Transformed the base design of my current project into components (pages as I'm using the React router). The main routes are done, as well as the 404 page. Let's see if I manage to do the functionality in 1 day.

**Thoughts:** Looks very good but obviously I want it to function as well. I think I took a bit too much time for the design.
